## Class: Account

The `Account` class represents a user's account in the trading simulation platform. It is responsible for managing user balances, tracking share transactions, calculating the portfolio value, and reporting profit/loss.

### Attributes:
- `username`: (str) the unique username for the account
- `balance`: (float) the current available balance in the account
- `holdings`: (dict) a dictionary where keys are share symbols (str) and values are integers representing the number of shares held
- `transactions`: (list) a list to record transaction history, storing dictionaries with transaction details

### Methods:

#### 1. `__init__(self, username: str)`
- Initializes an account instance with a username. Sets the initial balance to 0, initializes holdings as an empty dictionary, and creates an empty list for transactions.

#### 2. `create_account(self, username: str) -> None`
- Creates a new account with the provided username. Resets the initial state of the account (balance, holdings, transactions).

#### 3. `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Deposits a specified amount into the account.
- Validations:
  - Amount must be greater than zero.
- Side Effects:
  - Increases the account balance by the deposited amount.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list with 'Deposit' as type.

#### 4. `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Withdraws a specified amount from the account.
- Validations:
  - Amount must be greater than zero.
  - Withdrawn amount must not create a negative balance.
- Side Effects:
  - Decreases the account balance by the withdrawn amount.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list with 'Withdrawal' as type.

#### 5. `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
- Buys a specified quantity of shares for a given share symbol.
- Validations:
  - Quantity must be greater than zero.
  - Total cost (quantity * share price) must be less than or equal to the current balance.
- Side Effects:
  - Decreases the account balance by the total cost.
  - Updates the holdings for the specified symbol.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list with 'Buy' as type.

#### 6. `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> None`
- Sells a specified quantity of shares for a given share symbol.
- Validations:
  - Quantity must be greater than zero.
  - User must have enough shares of the specified symbol to sell.
- Side Effects:
  - Increases the account balance by the total proceeds from the sale (quantity * share price).
  - Updates the holdings for the specified symbol.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list with 'Sell' as type.

#### 7. `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the total current value of the user's portfolio based on the current share prices.
- Utilizes the `get_share_price(symbol)` function to fetch current prices for each share held.

#### 8. `get_profit_loss(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the profit or loss from the initial deposit based on the current balance and portfolio value.

#### 9. `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Returns the current holdings of the user as a dictionary where keys are share symbols and values are quantities.

#### 10. `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
- Returns the complete transaction history of the user as a list of dictionaries, detailing each transaction.

- Retrieves the current price of a share based on its symbol.
