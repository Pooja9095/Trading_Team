# Trading Team Crew - AI Agents for a Simulated Trading Platform
Welcome to the Trading Team Crew project! This project was built using CrewAI, a multi-agent framework where AI agents collaborate to build, test, and deliver real-world software.

This repo includes:
- Agent definitions for Engineering, Frontend, Backend, and Testing.
- Config files for reusable tasks.
- Auto-generated UI to simulate a trading platform with account management, trading actions, and reports.
- Gradio app to demo the final system.

## Technologies Used
- Python â‰¥3.10 and <3.14
- CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration
- Gradio for UI
- UV package manager
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini as the LLM backend for all agents

### Installation & Setup
Make sure you have Python and uv installed.
```bash
pip install uv
```

**Add your .env file:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Run the Crew
```bash
crewai run
```
This will:
- Load agents/tasks from src/trading_team/config/
- Run them sequentially to build the output/ folder
- Generate backend logic, frontend Gradio app, and (optionally) unit tests
  
## Run the final App
```bash
cd output
uv run app.py
```

- Modify `src/trading_team/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/trading_team/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/trading_team/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/trading_team/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks
  
## Understanding the Crew
The Trading_Team Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in the crew.
